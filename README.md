# ðŸ§  FinSolve AI â€” Role-Based GenAI Assistant (Scenario-Based FinTech Project)

## Scenario Overview

- **Company (Fictional):** FinSolve Technologies
- **Domain:** FinTechâ€ƒâ€ƒ
- **Function:** AI Engineering  
 
This project was developed as part of the **Codebasics Resume Project Challenge**, based on a real-world inspired FinTech scenario. The goal was to build a **GenAI assistant** that securely delivers department-specific information using **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

## Problem Statement

FinSolve Technologies (fictitious) is a leading FinTech company offering financial solutions to individuals and businesses.

Due to siloed data access and communication delays between departments like **Finance**, **Marketing**, **HR**, **Engineering**, and **C-Level**, the company faced operational inefficiencies. To solve this, the Chief Innovation Officer proposed building a chatbot that:

- Allows secure, on-demand access to department-specific data  
- Maintains data confidentiality with role-based access  
- Responds intelligently to employee queries using company knowledge

## Project Goal

As the AI Engineer , your task was to design and build a secure, intelligent assistant using GenAI. The chatbot:

- Authenticates users and maps them to a department role  
- Uses RAG to provide context-aware answers  
- Restricts data access based on user role  
- Responds to casual messages without triggering RAG  
- Denies access if a user asks for information beyond their scope
